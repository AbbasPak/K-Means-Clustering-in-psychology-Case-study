The Brief COPE is a widely used self-report questionnaire that assesses coping strategies individuals use 
when faced with stress or challenging situations. It was developed by Carver in 1997 as a shorter 
version of the original COPE Inventory. The questionnaire consists of 28 items that measure various coping strategies.

The Brief COPE questionnaire focuses on 14 different coping strategies:

o	*Active coping*: Taking active steps to deal with the problem.

o	*Planning*: Developing a plan of action to address the problem.

o	*Using instrumental support*: Seeking practical assistance or advice from others.

o	*Seeking informational support*: Gathering information to better understand the situation.

o	*Venting*: Expressing negative emotions and seeking emotional support.

o	*Positive reframing*: Finding positive aspects or silver linings in the situation.

o	*Acceptance*: Accepting the reality of the situation and learning to live with it.

o	*Religion*: Finding solace and support in religious or spiritual beliefs.

o	*Self-distraction*: Distracting oneself from the problem through engaging in other activities.

o	*Denial*: Refusing to accept or acknowledge the reality of the situation.

o	*Behavioral disengagement*: Giving up or withdrawing from the situation.

o	*Self-blame*: Blaming oneself for the problem or feeling guilty.

o	*Substance use*: Using substances such as alcohol or drugs to cope.

o	*Mental disengagement*: Avoiding thinking about the problem or distracting oneself mentally.

Participants are asked to rate how often they use each coping strategy on a 4-point Likert scale ranging from "I haven't been doing this at all" to "I've been doing this a lot." The results can provide insights into an individual's preferred coping strategies and their overall coping style.
